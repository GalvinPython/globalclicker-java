# Global Clicker API (but in Java)

uwu, it's kinda fast :3

# Why?

I originally wrote the Global Clicker API in Express, and it was the first API I published, so the code behind it is not only terrible, but the template I used was old, had lots of security issues from abandoned packages, and I've been running into a lot of performance issues with it.

I am also learning Java at college, and that was the main reason why I did it

# Does the current Global Clicker use it?

At the moment? No. But soon, yes.
